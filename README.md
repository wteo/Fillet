# Fillet
A web page of a cooking recipe for one of my favourite dishes: Salmon fillets with caramelised onion and wilted greens.

# About
The intention here is to see if I could replicate the design of an established website (https://www.goodfood.com.au/) without copying any existing codes.

I wrote everything from scratch.  

This is my second attempt at designing a website. Instead of just designing a static website, I also executed some basic Javascript functions to create a more dynamic website. This includes allowing a visitor who has tried out the recipe to leave a comment.
